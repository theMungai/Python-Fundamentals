# Python has no command for declaring a variable.
# A variable is created the moment you assign value to it.



x = 5 # Integers
y= "John" #A string must have single or double quotes.
z = 6.5  # An integer with a decimal is called FLOAT.
print(5)
print("John")
print(z)

# Specifying data type using casting.
# This is used in data conversion.
# Converting integer to string:
      str(3)  # this will print '3'

# Converting integer to float:
      float(5)  #This will print 5.0

# Converting any data type to integer
      int(2) #This will print 2


# || GETTING DATA TYPE ||
# You can get data type for variable using the type() function.
x = 5
y ="John"


            # ||  Python Variables Rules  ||

# Must start with a letter or an underscore.
# They are not separated using hyphens, instead, use an underscore.
# Variables cannot start with a number.
# They are not separated with spaces.
# They are case-sensitive.

#
           # || You can assign multiple variables in one line  ||
#
# Example:
# x, y, z = "Orange", "Banana", "Cherry"
# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)


              # || You can assign one value to multiple variables ||
# Example:
# x=y=z = "Orange"
# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)


                 # || UNPACKING a collection ||
# Example:
# fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
# x, y, z = fruits
# print(x)
# print(y)
# print(z)


   # || You can Output Multiple varibles by separating with a comma ||
# Example:
# x = "Python "
# y = "is "
# z = "awesome"
#
# print(x, y, z)


#        || You can also use + Operater to output multiple variables ||
# Example:
# x = "Python "
# y = "is "
# z = "awesome"
#
# print(x + y + z)
